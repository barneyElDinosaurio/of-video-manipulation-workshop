### introduction

in this workshop, we will explore ways of manipulating video in openframeworks with a focus on analysis of time and movement in video!

### prerequisites:

- [download openframeworks 0.9.0](http://openframeworks.cc/download/)
- IDE installed + set up (e.g. XCode on Mac, Visual Studio on Windows, ...)
- [OF tutorials "introduction" and "getting started"](http://openframeworks.cc/tutorials/)

### our goals today:

- get excited about openframeworks and creative coding!
- find out how much fun we can have with only a few lines of code :)

### questions we will explore:

- how can we load and display images in OF?
- how pixels are stored in OF?
- and how they can be manipulated?
- how can we use video in openframeworks?
    + loading a video file
    + using a webcam (as a real-time video feed!)
- how can we analyze movement over time in a video?
- how can we display an entire video in one frame using a process called "slit scan"?
- how are these concepts used in media art?
- where can this journey take us from here, what can we make with out newfound knowledge?
